cpp book content page 6-15  
learned to compile c++ file, display content in a new way
interpreted language vs compiled:
    interpreted, no compilation step, interpreter reads code (script txt file)
    more like a byte code and perform action. example: windows script.
 
 compiler generate object file then the object file run by machine. 

 linker connects the code that depend on library or other file and integrate
 these link to the executable

 cycle:
 code, compile, link, execute, debug
 in many case comple and link is one step
